'''
 The program  is designed to provide a user-friendly math practice experience,
 focusing on two control structures: selection and repetition. Upon execution, 
 the program starts by asking the user's name and greets them, informing them of its purpose.
 It then presents a menu with three options: 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, and 3 to exit the program.
 
If the user selects option 1, the program generates two random numbers,
asks the user for their sum, and checks if the user's answer is correct.
If it is correct, the program congratulates the user and waits for an Enter key press to continue.

If the user selects option 2, the program generates two random numbers,
asks the user for their difference, and checks if the user's answer is correct.
If it is correct, the program congratulates the user and waits for an Enter key press to continue.
If the answer is incorrect, it provides the correct answer.

If the user selects option 3, the program simply prints "Thank you" and exits.

To ensure the program's functionality, it imports the random module and 
utilizes a loop to keep presenting the menu until the user chooses to exit. 
Additionally, it provides meaningful user interactions and includes comments for clarity and documentation. 
The program offers an engaging and educational math practice experience while
demonstrating the use of control structures in Python.
